# Changelog

## [3.1.37+build.6] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **DasikLibrary Build 16 Sync**: Integrated the **Cached Boids Pattern**. Wolf packs now utilize $O(N)$ aggregated state computation, resolving performance leaks during large pack gatherings.
- **Biomechanical Smoothing**: Leverages the new library-side Lerp interpolation for smoother pack following without visual jitter.

### Changed
- **Release Alignment**: Synchronized workspace with Minecraft **26.1.2 ("Tiny Takeover") Release** and Fabric API `0.145.4`.

## [3.1.37+build.5] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Sound Polish**: Replaced the low-pitch `WOLF_SHAKE` howl placeholder with `WOLF_WHINE` to sound more natural and less like a monster.

## [3.1.37+build.4] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Debug Commands**: Added `/betterdogs debug` commands to force personality changes and trigger social actions.
  - *Example (Personality)*: `/betterdogs debug personality @e[type=wolf,distance=..5] aggressive`
  - *Example (Action)*: `/betterdogs debug action @e[type=wolf,distance=..5] howl`
  - *Actions available*: `howl`, `zoomies`, `mischief`, `disciplined`.
- **Snapshot Support**: Fully migrated API calls to match Minecraft 26.x Snapshot 11 (e.g. `getWorldClockTime()`, `LivingEntity` leadership).
- **Workspace Consolidation**: Refactored the environment to maintain a single source of truth for mod development in a cleaner folder structure.

### Changed
- **Modularity**: Split command execution logic into a dedicated Zenith-compliant `WolfCommandHelper.java`.

## [3.1.37+build.3] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Updated platform documentation (`Description Page.md`) to clearly detail the new **Unique Personality System** (Aggressive, Pacifist, Normal) with corresponding particle effects and behaviors.

## [3.1.37+build.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Dasik Library Integration**: Resolved build failures in project configuration by aligning Gradle mappings to the official 26.1 snapshot standards.

## [3.1.37+build.1] - 2026-03-03
- **Social Bonding**: New system where wolves track affinity with each other. High affinity suppresses "Blood Feuds".
- **Visual Polish**: Added "Play Bow" animation for wolves during social play fights.
- **Personality Traits**:
  - **Aggressive**: Wolves now scouting ahead of their owner.
  - **Pacifist**: Wolves now whine to alert hostiles within range.

### Fixed

## [3.1.36+build.5] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

## [3.1.36+build.4] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Toggles**: Added `bd_dogs_eat_raw_food` and `bd_dogs_eat_cooked_food` gamerules for granular control.
- **Mod Compatibility**: Features full support for modded foods via tags and name-based heuristics.

## [3.1.36+build.3] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Compatibility**: Reverted Mixin compatibility level from `JAVA_25` to `JAVA_22` to resolve warning.

## [3.1.36+build.2] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Leader-Follower Integration**: Wild wolves now naturally form packs using DasikLibrary's Leader-Follower API, with a deterministic max pack size of 8.

### Fixed

- **Ambient Event Spam**: Restored proper cooldown logic for ambient behaviors (like begging), preventing them from executing every tick.

## [3.1.36+build.1] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- **Versioning**: Adopted strict Build Number policy.

## [3.1.36] - 2026-02-16
