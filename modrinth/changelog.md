# � Initial Release - The "Worthy Companions" Update (v1.6.0)

Welcome to the official Modrinth launch of **Vanilla Outsider: Better Dogs**! While this is the first public upload, the version is marked as **1.6.0** to reflect the intensive internal development, balancing, and feature refinement that took place before this release.

This mod transforms your wolves from fragile followers into intelligent, capable, and unique companions.

## 🌟 Key Pillars of this Release

### 🧠 The Personality System

Every wolf you tame now receives a permanent personality:

* **Normal**: The classic vanilla experience with modern speed/stat buffs.
* **Aggressive**: A proactive protector that hunts hostiles near you.
* **Pacifist**: A gentle loyalist that only fights when you are directly hurt.

### 🛡️ Technical AI & Safety

* **Cliff Safety V2**: Dogs will no longer suicide-jump off cliffs or into ravines while chasing enemies.
* **Creeper Awareness**: Dogs are smart enough to flee when a Creeper is about to blow.
* **Fire/Lava Avoidance**: Significantly improved pathfinding around hazards.

### ⚔️ Combat & Survival

* **Armor Compatibility**: Full support for vanilla wolf armor.
* **Passive Healing**: Dogs now slowly recover health over time when out of combat.
* **The Gift System**: Loyal dogs will occasionally bring you loot based on their personality (Hunter's trophies vs. Nature foraging).
* **Friendly Fire Protection**: No more accidental sword sweeps killing your best friend.

### 🎚️ Extreme Configuration (v1.6.0+)

We have exposed almost every internal setting to the **Cloth Config** menu. You can now adjust:

* Personality spawn weights (e.g., make aggressive dogs rarer).
* Per-personality stats (Health, Speed, Damage, Knockback).
* Follow and Teleport distances.
* Gift cooldowns and Storm Anxiety frequency.

## 🛠️ Internal Fixes (Pre-Release Polish)

* Fixed a crash related to personality persistence in NBT data.
* Refactored attribute modifiers to use direct Mojang mappings (improving performance).
* Optimized skeleton-targeting logic for aggressive wolves.
* Fully localized all config keys into English (`en_us`).
