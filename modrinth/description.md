# 🐕 Make Wolves Worthy Companions

Every Minecraft player knows the pain: you spend hours finding a wolf, tame it, and five minutes later it jumps into lava or walks off a cliff.

**Vanilla Outsider: Better Dogs** completely overhauls wolf AI to make them smarter, safer, and livelier. With the new **Personality System**, every dog feels unique—some are aggressive protectors, while others are loyal pacifists.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Unique Personality System

When you tame a wolf, it's no longer just a copy-paste entity. It develops one of three permanent personalities, visually distinct by their particle effects:

  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150/00FF00/FFFFFF?text=Pacifist" alt="Pacifist Personality">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150/FFFF00/000000?text=Normal" alt="Normal Personality">
</p>

| Icon | Personality | Chance | Behavior |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 💢 | **Aggressive** | **33%** | The Guardian. Proactively attacks hostile mobs near you (Zombies, Skeletons, etc.). Great for base defense. |
| ❤️ | **Pacifist** | **33%** | The Loyal Friend. Only attacks mobs that hurt *you* first. Won't start fights, keeping itself safe. |
| ✨ | **Normal** | **34%** | The Classic. Behaves like a standard vanilla wolf, attacking what you attack. |

> [!NOTE]
> Personalities are permanent! You'll need to seek out and tame new wolves to find the perfect companion for your playstyle.

### 🛡️ Smart Safety AI

Stop worrying about your dogs killing themselves. Better Dogs includes 200 IQ self-preservation:

* **Lava & Fire Avoidance:** Wolves actively pathfind around dangerous blocks.
* **Cliff Safety:** Prevents jumping off ledges higher than 3 blocks.
* **Creeper Awareness:** Wolves will flee when they hear a Creeper hiss!
* **Anti-Stuck:** Improved pathfinding logic to keep them following close.

### ⚔️ Combat Overhaul

* **Knockback Resistance:** +50% resistance so they don't get punted into corners.
* **Friendly Fire Protection:** You can no longer accidentally hit your own dogs with a sword sweep.
  * *Emergency Override:* Sneak + Attack if you absolutely must hurt them.
* **Wild Survival:** Wild wolves now hunt prey only when hungry (below 50% HP) and can eat meat off the ground.
