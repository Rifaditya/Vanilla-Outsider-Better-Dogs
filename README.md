# 🐕 Better Dogs: A Social & Behavioral Overhaul (v3.4.8)

**Better Dogs** is a comprehensive overhaul of the Minecraft Wolf, replacing robotic behaviors with a dynamic, personality-driven social system. Built for the modern "Post-Obfuscation" era of Minecraft, it enhances the taming loop with genetics, social bonding, and smart survival logic.

## 🔥 New in v3.4.8: Categorical Mastery

The latest update reorganizes the configuration UI for better clarity and organization:

- **📂 Themed Categorization**: GameRules are now split into 6 distinct categories: **War, Litter, Health, Social, Spawning, and General**.
- **⚠️ Reset Warning**: Existing GameRule values may be reset to defaults due to this structural categorization.
- **🛡️ Registry Namespacing**: Full alignment with Zenith Protocol standards for unique identifiers.
- **🌍 Enhanced Localization**: Updated English and Indonesian labels for all new categories.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Unique Personality System
Every dog is assigned one of three personalities with unique traits:
- **Aggressive**: Fierce protectors that attack hostiles on sight. Proactively **Scouts** ahead.
- **Pacifist**: Gentle companions that avoid combat. Acts as a **Silent Alarm** for monsters.
- **Normal**: Balanced companions with standard vanilla-plus behavior.

### 🐕 Advanced Social AI
- **The Snitch System (Adult Correction)**: Adults intervene to discipline misbehaving puppies using the `AdultCorrectionGoal`.
- **Wild Wolf Packs**: Powered by **DasikLibrary**, wild wolves form cohesive packs (up to 8) with leaders and follower logic.
- **Social Events**: Morning zoomies, full-moon howling, and non-lethal social interactions.
- **Genetics**: Puppies inherit personality traits and stats from their parents via the `WolfBreedingMixin`.

### 🛡️ Smart Survival & Quality of Life
- **Cliff Safety**: Wolves detect fatal falls and stop chasing targets over voids or high drops.
- **Hazard Avoidance**: Improved pathfinding around lava, fire, and drowning hazards.
- **Dog Feeding**: Tamed dogs can scavenge dropped raw or cooked food from the ground to restore health via `EatGroundFoodGoal`.
