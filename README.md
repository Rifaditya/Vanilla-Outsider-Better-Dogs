## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Personality System

When you tame a wolf, it receives one of three permanent personalities:

| Personality | Default Chance | Behavior | Visual Cue |
|-------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| **Normal** | 60% | Classic vanilla behavior with stat buffs | ✨ Happy particles |
| **Aggressive** | 20% | Auto-attacks hostile mobs near owner | 💢 Angry particles |
| **Pacifist** | 20% | Only attacks when owner takes damage | ❤️ Heart particles |

### 🧬 Breeding Genetics (NEW in v1.7.0)

Wolves inherit personalities from their parents with configurable genetics:

- **Same parents**: 80% same personality, 10% each other
- **Normal + Other**: 40% each parent, 20% third
- **Aggressive + Pacifist**: 50% Normal (diluted), 25% each parent

### 🎁 Gift System

Loyal dogs bring you treasures based on their personality:

- **Aggressive**: Bones, Rotten Flesh, Arrows, rarely Iron
- **Pacifist**: Berries, Seeds, Flowers, rarely Glow Berries

### 🛡️ Smart Safety AI

- **Cliff Safety V2**: Wolves stop chasing enemies over voids/ravines
- **Lava & Fire Avoidance**: Active pathfinding around hazards
- **Creeper Awareness**: Wolves flee from hissing creepers
- **Friendly Fire Protection**: No accidental sword sweeps

### 🌩️ Environmental Awareness

- **Storm Anxiety**: Wolves whine and shake during thunderstorms
- **Passive Healing**: Slow HP recovery when out of combat

### ⚙️ Extreme Configuration

Almost every internal variable is configurable via Cloth Config:

- Per-personality stats (Health, Speed, Damage)
- Follow/Teleport distances
- Taming personality chances
- Breeding genetics percentages
- Gift cooldowns and trigger chances
