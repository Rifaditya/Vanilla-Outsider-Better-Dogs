## 📖 Overview

In vanilla Minecraft, tamed wolves have limited AI and often die in combat or get stuck. **Vanilla Outsider: Better Dogs** gives wolves unique personalities, smarter pathfinding, and combat improvements.

This mod is part of the **Vanilla Outsider** collection — mods that enhance vanilla Minecraft using only vanilla items, bringing an outsider's perspective to pure vanilla gameplay.

## ✨ Features

### 🐕 Personality System

When you tame a wolf, it randomly receives one of three personalities:

| Personality | Chance | Behavior | Visual Cue |
|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| **Aggressive** | 33% | Auto-attacks hostile mobs near owner | 💢 Angry particles |
| **Pacifist** | 33% | Only attacks when owner takes damage | ❤️ Heart particles |
| **Normal** | 34% | Vanilla behavior | ✨ Happy particles |

Personality is permanent and saved with the wolf.

### ⚔️ Combat Improvements

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Knockback Resistance** | 50% reduction - wolves are harder to push around |
| **Friendly Fire Protection** | You can't accidentally hurt your own wolf |
| **Emergency Override** | Sneak + attack to damage your wolf if needed |
| **Creeper Avoidance** | Wolves flee from hissing creepers |

### 🐺 Wild Wolf Enhancements

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hunt When Hurt** | Wild wolves only hunt prey when below 50% health |
| **Eat Ground Food** | Wild wolves pick up and eat dropped meat to heal |
| **Prey Animals** | Sheep, Rabbit, Chicken (not foxes or baby turtles) |

### 🛡️ Safety & Pathfinding

- Avoid lava and fire
- Avoid high falls (>3 blocks)
- Smarter pathfinding to avoid getting stuck

### ❤️ Passive Healing

Tamed wolves slowly regenerate 1 HP every 60 seconds when out of combat.
