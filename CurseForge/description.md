# 🐕 Make Wolves Worthy Companions (Now for 26.1 Snapshots!)

**No Backports:** I will **NOT** backport this mod to older versions (1.21, 1.20, etc.). Please do not ask.

Every Minecraft player knows the pain: you spend hours finding a wolf, tame it, and five minutes later it jumps into lava or walks off a cliff.

**Vanilla Outsider: Better Dogs** completely overhauls wolf AI to make them smarter, safer, and livelier. With the new **Personality System**, every dog feels unique—some are aggressive protectors, while others are loyal pacifists.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Beta Release for Minecraft 26.1 Snapshots**
> This version is built on the latest standard for Minecraft 26.1. It includes significant AI rewrites. Please report any bugs on GitHub!

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Unique Personality System

When you tame a wolf, it develops one of three permanent personalities, visually distinct by their particle effects.

</p>

| Icon | Personality | Default Chance | Behavior |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 💢 | **Aggressive** | **20%** | The Guardian. Proactively attacks hostile mobs near you. Now with configurable detection ranges! |
| ❤️ | **Pacifist** | **20%** | The Loyal Friend. Only attacks mobs that hurt *you* first. Won't start fights, keeping itself safe. |
| ✨ | **Normal** | **60%** | The Classic. Custom speeds and damage can now be applied to normal wolves via config. |

> [!NOTE]
> Personalities are permanent and can be inherited via breeding! Use the config to adjust how common each type is in your world.

### 🛡️ Smart Cliff Safety (Updated v1.7.5)

**Wolves are finally smart enough to NOT jump.**

* **Active Retreat:** When a wolf detects a steep drop (3+ blocks) or checks a target floating over the void, it doesn't just stop—it **actively walks backwards** 4 blocks away from the edge.
* **Airborne Checks:** If you knock a zombie off a cliff, your wolf won't dive after it.
* **Lava & Fire Warnings:** Wolves actively pathfind away from hazardous blocks.

### ⚙️ Standalone Config System (New v1.7.6)

Due to changes in the 26.1 snapshot environment, we have replaced the heavy `Cloth Config` dependency with a lightweight **Standalone JSON Loader**.

* **No GUI Needed:** Configuration is fully supported even in snapshot versions where Mod Menu isn't available.
* **Manual Control:** Edit `config/betterdogs.json` to tweak everything: Friendly Fire, Speed Buffs, Breeding Chances, and more.

### 🎁 The Gift System

Like cats, your loyal dogs will now bring you treasures based on their personality!

* **Aggressive**: Trophy items (Bones, Rotten Flesh).
* **Pacifist**: Foraged items (Berries, Flowers).

### 🌩️ Environmental Awareness

* **Storm Anxiety**: Wolves are scared of Thunderstorms! They will whine and shake in fear unless they are safe indoors or sitting.
