# 🐕 Make Wolves Worthy Companions (Fabric Edition)

> [!CAUTION]
> **No Backports:** I will **NOT** backport this mod to older versions. Please do not ask.

Every Minecraft player knows the pain: you spend hours finding a wolf, tame it, and five minutes later it jumps into lava or walks off a cliff.

**Vanilla Outsider: Better Dogs** completely overhauls wolf AI to make them smarter, safer, and livelier. Now powered by a high-performance **Event-Driven Scheduler (v3.0+)**, wolves act efficiently without lagging your world.

## ✨ Key Features (v3.1 Snitch Update)

### 🧠 Unique Personality System

When you tame a wolf, it develops one of three permanent personalities, visually distinct by their particle effects.

</p>

| Icon | Personality | Behavior |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 💢 | **Aggressive** | **The Guardian**. Proactively attacks hostile mobs. Enforces pack discipline. |
| ❤️ | **Pacifist** | **The Healer**. Avoids combat unless you are hurt. High health, low damage. |
| ✨ | **Normal** | **The Classic**. Balanced stats and standard behavior. |

### 🐕 Advanced Social AI (The "Snitch" System)

Wolves now interact with each other in complex, organic ways using our new **Event-Driven AI**:

* **Baby Retaliation (The One-Bite Rule):** If you hit a baby wolf, it doesn't just take it. It bites you back **EXACTLY ONCE** to teach you a lesson, then forgives you.
* **Adult Correction (The Snitch System):** If a baby bites you, nearby Aggressive Adults will intervene. The baby "snitches" on itself via the Event System, causing one adult to walk over and discipline it with **ONE BITE**. No gang-ups, no death loops.
* **Blood Feuds:** Sometimes, discipline goes too far. There is a small chance (5%) that a correction turns into a permanent **Blood Feud**, where the wolves will fight to the death.
* **Play Fighting:** Large packs of wolves will now engage in safe, non-lethal play fights to burn off energy. They will chase and nip at each other without taking real damage.

### 🛡️ Smart Safety AI

Stop worrying about your dogs killing themselves:

* **Cliff Safety:** Wolves detect airborne targets and **STOP** chasing instead of jumping after them.
* **Lava & Fire Avoidance:** Wolves actively pathfind around dangerous blocks.
* **Creeper Awareness:** Wolves flee when they hear a Creeper hiss!

### 🎁 The Gift System

Like cats, your loyal dogs will now bring you treasures based on their personality!

* **Aggressive**: Brings "trophies" from their hunts (Bones, Rotten Flesh).
* **Pacifist**: Brings "foraged" items from nature (Berries, Flowers).
