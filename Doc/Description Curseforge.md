# Vanilla Outsider: Better Dogs

**Refined Wolf AI for the Purist.**

Better Dogs makes wolves useful, unique, and biologically interesting without adding complex GUIs or magic systems.

## Key Features

- **Personality System**: Each wolf has unique traits visible in their behavior (e.g. running from fights or charging head-on).
- **Survival Instincts**: No more wolves jumping into lava or off cliffs.
- **Immersion**: subtle sounds and behaviors during rain and thunder.

## Compatibility

Works on **Fabric** and **NeoForge**. Config file located at `config/betterdogs.json`.
