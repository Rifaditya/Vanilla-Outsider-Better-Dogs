  # Better Dogs
  ## Philosophy Fit
  This mod strictly adheres to the Vanilla Outsider philosophy by enhancing the vanilla Wolf with deeper systems and reliability. It removes AI "jank" (lava/cliff deaths) without automated combat. The new mechanics (Personalities, Genetics, Social AI) add depth to the taming loop, while the Gift System rewards player investment.

  ## Mechanics
  ### Core: personality System
  - **Types:** Normal, Aggressive, Pacifist.
  - **Individual DNA:** Every dog has a unique "preference roll" (UUID-based) determining participation in social events.
  - **Genetics:** Advanced breeding passes down traits with configurable probability matrices.

  ### Social AI (The Snitch System)
  - **Mischief:** Aggressive puppies may randomly provoke conflict.
  - **Bite-Back:** Puppies retaliate if struck by owners.
  - **Correction:** Aggressive adults discipline misbehaving puppies.
  - **Blood Feud:** Rare escalation turnings logic into permanent vendettas.

  ### Immersive Behaviors & Events
  - **Zoomies:** High-energy morning/rain activity.
  - **Group Howl:** Full moon pack vocalization.
  - **Play Fighting:** Safe spars to burn energy (Large Packs).
  - **Storm Anxiety:** Reactive fear behavior during thunder.

  ### "Smart" Survival AI
  - **Cliff Safety:** Detection logic prevents fatal drops.
  - **Hazard Avoidance:** Actively navigates around lava/fire.
  - **Teleport 2.0:** Prioritizes running/catch-up speed over vibrating teleports.
  - **Friendly Fire:** Protection from sweep attacks.

  ### Config Mastery 2.0 (Native Game Rules)
  - **Registry Integration:** All 40+ AI magic numbers are exposed via native Minecraft Game Rules.
  - **Custom Category:** Integrated into a dedicated "Better Dogs" tab in the Game Rules UI.
