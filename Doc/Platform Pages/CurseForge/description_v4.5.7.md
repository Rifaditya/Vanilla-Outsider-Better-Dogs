# 🐕 Better Dogs

**No Backports:** This mod targets **Minecraft 26.2+**. Older versions are unsupported.

> **Make Wolves Worthy Companions. Smarter, Safer, Livelier.**

Every Minecraft player knows the pain: you spend hours finding a wolf, tame it, and five minutes later it jumps into lava or walks off a cliff. **Better Dogs** overhauls wolf AI to make them effective partners. Powered by a high-performance **Event-Driven AI Scheduler**, they act efficiently without sacrificing performance.

Part of the **Vanilla Outsider Collection** — mods that refine the vanilla experience with modern standards.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Personality Intelligence
When tamed, wolves develop one of three permanent personalities. When in active **Guard Mode**, they emit tiny, custom-colored dust particles indicating their personality:

</p>

- 💢 **Aggressive**: The Guardian. Proactively attacks hostile mobs and scouts ahead. Emits red dust particles (`0xFF3333`) on patrol.
- ❤️ **Pacifist**: The Healer. Avoids combat unless you are hurt. High health, low damage. Emits green/teal dust particles (`0x00FF88`) on patrol.
- ✨ **Normal**: The Classic. Balanced stats and standard vanilla-plus behavior. Emits gold/yellow dust particles (`0xFFD700`) on patrol.

### 🛡️ Tamed Wolf Guard Mode
Right-click a tamed wolf with a bone to toggle **Guard Mode** (consuming exactly 1 bone) and anchor the wolf to its current spot:
- **Patrol Patterns**:
  - **Aggressive**: Paces in a circular/polygon shape along its outer perimeter sweep (80% range), pausing to scan outward for threats.
  - **Normal**: Sentry posture at the guard post (range = 0), or radial patrols outward and back (range > 0).
  - **Pacifist**: Close protective orbital circular pacing around the post.
- **Auto-Targeting & Chase Caps**: Normal and Aggressive guards automatically attack hostiles within their range but are capped from chasing targets too far to prevent them from being lured away.
- **Watchdog Alarms & Grace Buffs**: Pacifist sentinels whine and emit warning note particles when hostiles approach, applying Regeneration and Resistance to owners/allies if the gamerule is enabled.
- **Safety Gating**: Toggling Guard Mode requires **Shift + Right Click** while holding a bone to prevent accidental activation during taming. Guard Mode is also gated strictly to the wolf's owner.

### 📏 Dynamic Follower Spread Scaling
Follow/spread spacing of wild and tamed wolf packs scales dynamically based on the number of active followers:
- Spacing increases mathematically based on the square root formula: $f(N) = \text{multiplier} \times \sqrt{N - 1}$ to prevent visual overcrowding.
- Fully configurable via 4 native GameRules: `bd_tamed_pack_spread_multiplier`, `bd_tamed_pack_spread_max`, `bd_wild_pack_spread_multiplier`, `bd_wild_pack_spread_max`.

### 🤝 Advanced Social AI
- **Social Bonding (Affinity)**: Dogs form relationships within their pack. Socializing builds trust and reduces accidental infighting.
- **Adult Correction**: Aggressive adults discipline misbehaving puppies, preventing death loops.
- **Pack Genetics & Recovery**: Puppies inherit personality traits and stats from their parents. Breeding related wolves (parents/offspring or siblings) causes inbreeding depression, producing small runts with permanently stunted stats. Breeding an inbred wolf with an unrelated healthy wolf allows the offspring to recover their lineage's full genetic potential.
- **Active Inbreeding Cure (Optional)**: A customizable config and GameRule toggle (disabled by default) allows players to instantly cure an inbred wolf by feeding it a Golden Apple.
- **Litter System**: Wolves can produce multiple puppies in a single breed — each with independent personality rolls and stats.

### 🛡️ Smart Survival AI
- **Cliff Safety**: Wolves detect fatal drops and airborne targets, stopping dangerous chases.
- **Hazard Awareness**: Improved pathfinding around lava, fire, and drowning hazards.
- **Creeper Awareness**: Wolves flee from hissing Creepers!
- **Dog Feeding**: Tamed dogs scavenge dropped raw or cooked food from the ground to restore health — no manual feeding required.

### 📡 Behavioral Specialization
- **Scouting**: Aggressive dogs proactively range ahead to clear your path.
- **Silent Alarm**: Pacifist dogs emit a high-pitched whine when they detect nearby monsters.
- **Gift System**: Loyal dogs bring you treasures based on their personality.
- **Debug Tools**: Use `/betterdogs debug` to test pack interactions and behaviors (Locked behind OP permissions and a safety GameRule).

### 🌤️ Immersive Events
- **Zoomies**: Dogs burst into hyperactive sprints in the morning or when it starts raining — pure joy!
- **Group Howl**: Under a full moon, wolves trigger pack-wide howling sessions that spread to nearby pack members.
- **Storm Anxiety**: Thunderstorms make dogs anxious — they whine, tremble, and pace nervously until the storm passes. This is highly dependent on their personality: Pacifist dogs are extremely prone to anxiety, Normal dogs have standard chances, and Aggressive dogs are completely immune.

### 🏰 Wild Wolf Territoriality
Wild wolf packs are now dynamic, territorial entities led by a dominant leader:
- **Territorial Probability Matrix**: Pack interactions now utilize a complex, personality-driven matrix. No two disputes are the same!
- **Dynamic Outcomes**: Depending on leader personalities, packs may **Merge** (Dominance based), engage in **War** (1v1 Duels or Pack Combat), or peacefully **Retreat** to maintain their own borders.
- **Configurable Instincts**: Use GameRules to fine-tune exactly how Aggressive, Normal, and Pacifist leaders react to each other.
- **1v1 Leader Duels**: If a dispute escalates to War, leaders engage in a cinematic 1v1 duel to settle dominance.
- **Yield & Merge**: Defeated packs yield and **merge** with the winning pack, allowing for the natural formation of massive wolf colonies.
- **Wild Personality AI (New Default)**: Out of the box, wild pack members exhibit unique behaviors (like Aggressive hunting or Pack Retreats) while anchored to their leader.
- **Dynamic Spawning & Reinforcements**: When a pack goes to war or is challenged, nearby wild wolves can spawn or join as reinforcements to defend their pack's territory.

### 💻 Server-Side Optional & Client Gating
- **Server-Side Optional**: Better Dogs is fully compatible with vanilla clients! Vanilla clients can connect to servers running the mod without installing it.
- **P2P Multiplayer Compatibility (Minecraft 26.2+)**: In theory, singleplayer hosts opening their world to online multiplayer using the new Minecraft 26.2 P2P friends system will work seamlessly with vanilla clients (your friends do not need to install the mod). *Note: As this is a newly released pre-release feature, P2P compatibility has not been extensively tested. If you find any issues, please report them to our GitHub repository!*
- **Dedicated Server Support**: Client-only rendering logic is isolated to prevent classloading crashes on headless dedicated servers.
- **GUI Config Integration**: Fully supports configuration GUI integrations via **ModMenu** + **Cloth Config** in singleplayer mode.

  </p>
- **Production Stable**: Fully compatible with high-performance engines like **C2ME**, ensuring safe multi-threaded AI execution.
- **Performance Hardened**: All AI logic is performance-optimized using **DasikLibrary 1.7.4**, ensuring zero console spam and smooth server TPS even with massive packs.

## ⚙️ Configuration (Native Game Rules)

No messy config files. Better Dogs uses the **Native Minecraft Game Rules** system. All 50+ mod parameters are grouped into a dedicated **"Better Dogs"** category in the official UI.

> [!TIP]
> **Too many rules?** If the game rule screen feels cluttered, we highly recommend installing **[Collapsible Game Rules](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/collapsible-gamerules)**. It will automatically group the new Personality Matrix settings into clean, expandable folders!
