# Better Dogs Changelog: 1.9.5-26.1

**Release Date:** 2026-01-23  
**Minecraft Version:** 26.1-snapshot-4  
**Java Version:** 25

## 🏗 Architecture Reversion

- **Fabric Native Reversion**: Pivot from Multi-Loader (NeoForge/Fabric) back to it being **Fabric only**.
  - *Reasoning*: Maintaining two loaders is way too hard and I'm too stupid to keep fighting NeoForge's snapshot jank. We're going Fabric-only to save my sanity.
- **Source Consolidation**: Smashed `common` and `fabric` into one root structure. Deleted NeoForge and all the extra dependencies.

## 🛠 Technical Changes

- **Java 25 Standardization**: Fully migrated the build system and toolchain to **Java 25**.
- **Fabric Attachment API**: Fully integrated Fabric's native Attachment API for persistent wolf data.
- **Build System**: Standardized on Fabric Loom 1.14.7.
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved a startup crash (`MixinApplyError`) by redirecting taming logic injection from `setTame` to `applyTamingSideEffects`.

## ⚙️ Mod Configuration

- **Standalone JSON Loader**: Uses `config/betterdogs.json` instead of Cloth Config to ensure compatibility with snapshot versions where Mod Menu is absent.
