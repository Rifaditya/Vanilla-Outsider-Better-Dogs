# Better Dogs Changelog: 1.09.009

**Release Date:** 2026-01-24  
**Minecraft Version:** 26.1-snapshot-4  
**Java Version:** 25

## ⚔️ Domestic Retaliation & Intervention

- **Owner-Attack Bypass**: Overrode hardcoded vanilla blocks in `TamableAnimal.canAttack` and `Wolf.wantsToAttack`.
  - *Utility*: Allows baby wolves to correctly retaliate when struck by their owners.
  - *Intervention*: Enables aggressive adults to target misbehaving babies to "enforce" manners.
- **AI Priority Re-tuning**: Set domestic retaliation and intervention goals to priority 0 for instantaneous response.
- **Aggressive State Handling**: Intervention now correctly triggers the wolf's aggressive visual state.

## 🏗 Convention & Standards

- **New Versioning Strategy**: Transitioned to the `x.xx.xxx` Semantic Versioning format (e.g., 1.09.008).
- **Protocol Update**: Documented the "Owner-Attack Barrier" in `Better_modder_agent_protocol.yaml` for consistency across projects.

## 🛠 Technical Fixes

- **Mixin Consolidation**: Cleaned up `WolfMixin` logic to use proper `@Inject` patterns for bypasses instead of direct overrides where possible.
- **Logging**: Added server-side logging for adult intervention events.
